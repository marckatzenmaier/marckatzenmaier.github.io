About

I am currently working as a Doctor of Philosophy student at the [Institute for Computational Science](https://www.ics.uzh.ch/en/) at the [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html), supervised by [Prof. Dr. Jan Dirk Wegner](https://igp.ethz.ch/personen/person-detail.html?persid=186562), and I am affiliated with the [EcoVision Lab](https://prs.igp.ethz.ch/ecovision.html), located in [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), since 2021. I received my Master's degree in Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence at [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/) (TUM). My Master thesis focused on Self-Supervised Ego-Path Prediction for autonomous driving. I did my Bachelor at [Reutlingen University](https://www.reutlingen-university.de/home/) in Mechatronic. My research interests include but are not limited to computer vision, deep learning, and instance segmentation.
